# PHP Test Runner

This is the test runner for Exercism's v3 platform.
It meets the complete spec for testing all exercises.

## Basic components

### Docker image

The website uses isolated Docker images to run untrusted code in a sandbox.
The image provided by this repository consists of PHP 8.3.4 (PHPUnit 10).
All final assets are built into the image, because the image does not have network access once in use.

Includes PHP extensions: ds, intl

### Test runner

Test running a solution is coordinated by a bash script at `bin/run.sh` taking 3 positional arguments:

```text
bin/run.sh <test-slug> <directory path to solution> <directory path for output>
```

This is what runs inside the production Docker image when students submit their code.

### Testing the test runner

In `./tests/` are golden tests to verify that the test runner behaves as expected.
The CI uses `bin/run-tests.sh` to execute them.

### Running tests in Docker locally

This is the recommended way to use this locally.
Use `bin/run-in-docker.sh <test-slug> <directory path to solution> <directory path for output>` and `bin/run-tests-in-docker.sh` to locally build and run the Docker image.

### JUnit to JSON

PHPUnit can natively output tests run to JUnit XML format, but Exercism requires output in JSON format.
A PHP-based app is located in the `junit-handler` folder.
It provides a translation layer from one format to the other incorporating `task_id` identification and test code inclusion.
