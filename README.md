# PHP Test Runner

This is a minimal test runner for Exercism's v3 platform.  It meets the minimal spec for testing _practice exercises_.  It does not currently parse the test case code being run, therefore it does not meet the standard for testing _concept exercises_.

## Basic components

### Dockerimage

The website uses isolated docker images to run untrusted code in a sandbox.  Image consists of PHP 8.1.3 (PHPUnit 9) and Node 14 (npm 7.5.4). All final assets are built into the image, because the image does not have network access once in use.

Includes php extensions: ds, intl

### Test runner

Test running a solution is coordinated by a bash script at `bin/run.sh` taking 3 positional arguments:

```text
> bin/run.sh <test-slug> <directory path to solution> <directory path for output>
```

### JUnit to JSON

PHPUnit can natively output tests run to junit xml format, but Exercism requires output in json format. A typescript-based app is located in the `junit-to-json` folder which is compiled to javascript when the image is built. It provides a translation layer from one format to the other.

```text
> node junit-to-json/dist/index.js <path to xml input> <path for json output>
```
